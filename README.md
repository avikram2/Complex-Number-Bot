# Complex-Number-Bot
Code for a Discord Complex Number Bot

The bot has two commands, $inputRectangular and $inputPol. 
$inputRectangular takes in two numbers, the real and imaginary components, and returns the polar representation while $inputPol takes in r, theta values 
and returns the rectangular representation.

The code for the Bot is in main.py.

Bot is run on Repl.It and Flask and Uptime Robot are used to ensure that the bot is available nearly continuously. 

This Bot is already used in two academic Discord channels, with a combined membership of 250 people.
